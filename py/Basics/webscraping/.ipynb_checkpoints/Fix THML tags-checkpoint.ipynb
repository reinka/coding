       " 'I am not an expert on all the arguments in this field, and my views remain very open to change with new information. In the face of epistemic disagreements with other very smart observers, it makes sense to grant some credence to a variety of viewpoints. Each person brings unique contributions to the discussion by virtue of his or her particular background, experience, and intuitions.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"To date, I have not found a detailed analysis of how those who are moved more by preventing suffering than by other values should approach singularity issues. This seems to me a serious gap, and research on this topic deserves high priority. In general, it's important to expand discussion of singularity issues to encompass a broader range of participants than the engineers, technophiles, and science-fiction nerds who have historically pioneered the field.\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " ' \\\\section{Is \"the singularity\" crazy?} In fall 2005, a friend pointed me to Ray Kurzweil\\'s \\\\textit{\\\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_Age\\\\_of\\\\_Spiritual\\\\_Machines}{The Age of Spiritual Machines}}. This was my first introduction to \"singularity\" ideas, and I found the book pretty astonishing. At the same time, much of it seemed rather implausible to me. In line with the attitudes of my peers, I assumed that Kurzweil was crazy and that while his ideas deserved further inspection, they should not be taken at face value.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'In 2006 I discovered Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky, and I began to follow the organization then called the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), which is now \\\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine\\\\_Intelligence\\\\_Research\\\\_Institute}{MIRI}. I took SIAI\\'s ideas more seriously than Kurzweil\\'s, but I remained embarrassed to mention the organization because the first word in SIAI\\'s name sets off \"insanity alarms\" in listeners.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'I began to study machine learning in order to get a better grasp of the AI field, and in fall 2007, I switched my college major to computer science. As I read textbooks and papers about machine learning, I felt as though \"narrow AI\" was very different from the strong-AI fantasies that people painted. \"AI programs are just a bunch of hacks,\" I thought. \"This isn\\'t intelligence; it\\'s just people using computers to manipulate data and perform optimization, and they dress it up as \\'AI\\' to make it sound sexy.\" Machine learning in particular seemed to be just a computer scientist\\'s version of statistics. Neural networks were just an elaborated form of logistic regression. There were stylistic differences, such as computer science\\'s focus on cross-validation and bootstrapping instead of testing parametric models -- made possible because computers can run data-intensive operations that were inaccessible to statisticians in the 1800s. But overall, this work didn\\'t seem like the kind of \"real\" intelligence that people talked about for general AI.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'This attitude began to change as I learned more cognitive science. Before 2008, my ideas about human cognition were vague. Like most science-literate people, I believed the brain was a product of physical processes, including firing patterns of neurons. But I lacked further insight into what the black box of brains might contain. This led me to be confused about what \"free will\" meant until mid-2008 and about what \"consciousness\" meant until late 2009. Cognitive science showed me that the brain was in fact very much like a computer, at least in the sense of being a deterministic information-processing device with distinct algorithms and modules. When viewed up close, these algorithms could look as \"dumb\" as the kinds of algorithms in narrow AI that I had previously dismissed as \"not really intelligence.\" Of course, animal brains combine these seemingly dumb subcomponents in dazzlingly complex and robust ways, but I could now see that the difference between narrow AI and brains was a matter of degree rather than kind. It now seemed plausible that broad AI could emerge from lots of work on narrow AI combined with stitching the parts together in the right ways.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"So the singularity idea of artificial general intelligence seemed less crazy than it had initially. This was one of the rare cases where a bold claim turned out to look \\\\textit{more} probable on further examination; usually extraordinary claims lack much evidence and crumble on closer inspection. I now think it's quite likely (maybe ~75\\\\%) that humans will produce at least a human-level AI within the next ~300 years conditional on no major disasters (such as sustained world economic collapse, global nuclear war, large-scale nanotech war, etc.), and also ignoring \\\\href{http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic\\\\_bias}{anthropic considerations}.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " ' \\\\section{The singularity is more than AI} The \"singularity\" concept is broader than the prediction of strong AI and can refer to \\\\href{http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/schools}{several}  distinct sub-meanings. Like with most ideas, there\\'s a lot of fantasy and exaggeration associated with \"the singularity,\" but at least the core idea that technology will progress at an accelerating rate for some time to come, absent major setbacks, is not particularly controversial. Exponential growth is the standard model in economics, and while this can\\'t continue forever, it has been a robust pattern throughout human and even pre-human history.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'MIRI emphasizes AI for a good reason: At the end of the day, the long-term future of our galaxy will be dictated by AI, not by biotech, nanotech, or other lower-level systems. AI is the \"brains of the operation.\" Of course, this doesn\\'t automatically imply that AI should be the primary focus of our attention. Maybe other revolutionary technologies or social forces will come first and deserve higher priority. In practice, I think focusing on AI specifically seems quite important even relative to competing scenarios, but it\\'s good to explore many areas in parallel to at least a shallow depth.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'In addition, I don\\'t see a sharp distinction between \"AI\" and other fields. Progress in AI software relies heavily on computer hardware, and it depends at least a little bit on other fundamentals of computer science, like programming languages, operating systems, distributed systems, and networks. AI also shares significant overlap with neuroscience; this is especially true if \\\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole\\\\_brain\\\\_emulation}{whole brain emulation}  arrives before bottom-up AI. And everything else in society matters a lot too: How intelligent and engineering-oriented are citizens? How much do governments fund AI and cognitive-science research? (I\\'d encourage \\\\href{http://utilitarian-essays.com/differential-intellectual-progress.html}{less}  rather than more.) What kinds of military and commercial applications are being developed? Are other industrial backbone components of society stable? What memetic lenses does society have for understanding and grappling with these trends? And so on. The AI story is part of a larger story of social and technological change, in which one part influences other parts.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Significant trends in AI may not look like the AI we see in movies. They may not involve animal-like cognitive agents as much as more \"boring\", business-oriented computing systems. Some of the most transformative computer technologies in the period 2000-2014 have been drones, smart phones, and social networking. These all involve some AI, but the AI is mostly used as a component of a larger, non-AI system, in which many other facets of software engineering play at least as much of a role.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Nonetheless, it seems nearly inevitable to me that digital intelligence in some form will eventually leave biological humans in the dust, \\\\textit{if} technological progress continues without faltering. This is almost obvious when we zoom out and notice that the history of life on Earth consists in one species outcompeting another, over and over again. Ecology\\'s \\\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive\\\\_exclusion\\\\_principle}{competitive exclusion principle}  suggests that in the long run, either humans or machines will ultimately occupy the role of the most intelligent beings on the planet, since \"When one species has even the slightest advantage or edge over another then the one with the advantage will dominate in the long term.\"\\\\section{Will society realize the importance of AI?} The basic premise of superintelligent machines who have different priorities than their creators has been in public consciousness for many decades. \\\\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aimag.v7i2.540}{Arguably}  even \\\\textit{Frankenstein}, published in 1818, expresses this basic idea, though more modern forms include \\\\textit{2001: A Space Odyssey} (1968), \\\\textit{The Terminator} (1984), \\\\textit{I, Robot} (2004), and \\\\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\\\\_intelligence\\\\_in\\\\_fiction}{many more}. Probably most people in Western countries have at least heard of these ideas if not watched or read pieces of fiction on the topic.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So why do most people, including many of society\\'s elites, ignore strong AI as a serious issue? One reason is just that the world is really big, and there are many important (and not-so-important) issues that demand attention. Many people think strong AI is too far off, and we should focus on nearer-term problems. In addition, it\\'s possible that science fiction itself is part of the reason: People may write off AI scenarios as \"just science fiction,\" as I would have done prior to late 2005. (Of course, this is partly for good reason, since depictions of AI in movies are usually very unrealistic.) Often, citing Hollywood is taken as a thought-stopping deflection of the possibility of AI getting out of control, without much in the way of substantive argument to back up that stance. \\\\href{http://www.businessinsider.com/artificial-intelligence-not-danger-to-humanity-2015-2}{For example}: \"let\\'s please keep the discussion firmly within the realm of reason and leave the robot uprisings to Hollywood screenwriters.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'For a long time I inclined toward Yudkowsky\\'s vision of AI, because I respect his opinions and didn\\'t ponder the details too closely. This is also the more prototypical example of rebellious AI in science fiction. In early 2014, a friend of mine challenged this view, noting that computing power is a severe limitation for human-level minds. My friend suggested that AI advances would be slow and would diffuse through society rather than remaining in the hands of a single developer team. As I\\'ve read more AI literature, I think this soft-takeoff view is pretty likely to be correct. Science is always a gradual process, and almost all AI innovations historically have moved in tiny steps. I would guess that even the evolution of humans from their primate ancestors was a \"soft\" takeoff in the sense that no single son or daughter was vastly more intelligent than his or her parents. The evolution of technology in general has been fairly continuous. I probably agree with Paul Christiano \\\\href{http://web.archive.org/web/20150317142946/http://paulfchristiano.com/ai-impacts/}{that}\"it is unlikely that there will be rapid, discontinuous, and unanticipated developments in AI that catapult it to superhuman levels [...].\"\\n',\n",

At some point perhaps governments will take control, in the style of the Manhattan Project, and they\\'ll keep the advances secret. But even then, I expect that the internal advances by the research teams will add cognitive abilities in small steps. Even if you have a theoretically optimal intelligence algorithm, it\\'s constrained by computing resources, so you either need lots of hardware or approximation hacks (or most likely both) before it can function effectively in the high-dimensional state space of the real world, and this again implies a slower trajectory. Marcus Hutter\\'s AIXI(tl) is an example of a theoretically optimal general intelligence, but most AI researchers feel it won\\'t work for artificial general intelligence (AGI) because it\\'s astronomically expensive to compute.

Those who view AGI as fundamentally complex have more concrete results to show, and their approach is by far more mainstream among computer scientists and neuroscientists. Of course, proofs about theoretical models like Turing machines and lambda calculus are also mainstream, and few can dispute their importance. But Turing-machine theorems do little to constrain our understanding of what AGI will actually look like in the next few centuries. That said, there's significant peer disagreement on this topic, so epistemic modesty is warranted. In addition, \\\\textit{if} the MIRI view is right, we might have more scope to make an impact to AGI safety, and it would be possible that important discoveries could result from a few mathematical insights rather than lots of detailed engineering work. Also, most AGI research is more engineering-oriented, so MIRI's distinctive focus on theory, especially abstract topics like decision theory, may target an underfunded portion of the space of AGI-safety research.\\n\",\n",
